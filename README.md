# hltv-data
This file contains nodejs code for scraping data of counter-strike match from hltv. Api from npm(https://www.npmjs.com/package/hltv/v/2.2.0) was used to get the matchId of the time period we want. A proxy server named
FlareSolverr capable of mimicking user browsing behav-ior to circumvent Cloudflareâ€™s anti-bot detection was used as well.
Data of big matches called by hltv was saved in several json files.
